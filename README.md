#About the Tool:
-----------

Chef is a Configuration Management tool which automates how the infrastructure is configured, deployed and configured across networks on machines which could be physical, on cloud or virtual. The use of such a tool helps in ensuring that the files, softwares, packages and services are present on the respective machines and are working as required.  
  
The need for such tool arises from the fact that the real world applications require management of multiple server machines each performing a different function. Manual management of operations and configuration in such an environment can be a daunting task and hence this calls for tools like Chef which provide Infrastructure as Code.
